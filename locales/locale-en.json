It is also during this secondary step that the actors received their pensions, therefore promoting them to the status of ‘pensionnaire’, which is a title denoting an association with the troupe, though not full membership, that was - as a general rule - held for a minimum of two years. The time it takes an actor to transition from ‘pensionnaire’ to full society member varies, but generally follows the aforementioned rule, lasting between one and two years. However, there are cases where this progression occurs over a much longer period, as with Bellemont, who despite his ubiquitous presence on stage, remains  a ‘pensionnaire’ for 11 years before being properly inducted into the troupe."

M. Bellecour is known for his kindness and his peacemaking, and while he bitterly denounces some of his colleagues’ decisions in his final years, he remains a voice of reason within the troupe. Mme Bellecour, on the other hand, experiences more personal conflict with her fellow actors. A letter she writes to the Assembly on October 5, 1780 in regard to an “dishonest scene” caused by Mlle La Chassaigne shows Mme Bellecour acknowledging her own impetuous character."
