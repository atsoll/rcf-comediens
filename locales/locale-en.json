Common wording such as ‘which ever roles suit them’, ‘comedic or tragic roles’, or even ‘wherever they may be of use’ demonstrates how an actor’s debut period was a chance for them to explore their range. However, in certain cases it is specified that a candidate is to act as a double to one or several existing members of the troupe, or inherit the roles traditionally played by a retiring member. The latter is the case of Préville, who replaced Poisson.

In the 1760’s, the associated documents specify several key elements, notably specific information pertaining to the specialisation of certain actors or actresses, precise beyond what was established during their period of debut. It is also during this secondary step that the actors received their pensions, therefore promoting them to the status of ‘pensionnaire’, which is a title denoting an association with the troupe, though not full membership, that was - as a general rule - held for a minimum of two years. The time it takes an actor to transition from ‘pensionnaire’ to full society member varies, but generally follows the aforementioned rule, lasting between one and two years. However, there are cases where this progression occurs over a much longer period, as with Bellemont, who despite his ubiquitous presence on stage, remains  a ‘pensionnaire’ for 11 years before being properly inducted into the troupe."
